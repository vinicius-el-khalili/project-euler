# project-euler
Project Euler [1] is a website containing a series of increasingly complex computational problems that can be solved throught any turing complete programming language. In order to learn and practice JavaScript throught a bottom-up approach, I created a simple and minimalistic interactive page that displays the enunciate of some problems from Project Euler and solves them in real time.
With this project, I intend to get comfortable with the basic functionalities of JS.
